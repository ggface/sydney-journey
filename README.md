#Sydney Journey
Android application of different Sydney' venues.

Features:
• Start screen allows watch and manage to some venue's marker.
• If you allow application to use geo location you can view all venues sorted by distance from you.
• You can add a new venue using a long touch gesture. Touch gesture on any venue' marker allows you manage to selected venue (change description or delete one). You can't delete any venues loaded from server side.

Notes:
I performed application based on MVP pattern. Also I used RxJava and Room library from Android Architecture Components.
